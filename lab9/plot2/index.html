  <h1>Plot 2 – Sleep vs Productivity</h1>

    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
      As sleep hours increase, productivity improves. However, higher stress or extended screen time may lower
      this positive effect. I expect high productivity at around 7–8 hours of sleep with low stress and balanced screen time.
    </p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>How does sleep duration affect productivity when considering stress and screen time?</p>

    <h3>Data Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X-axis:</strong> Sleep Hours (5.5–9 hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Y-axis:</strong> Productivity (1–5 scale)</li>
      <li><strong>Circle Size:</strong> Screen Time (hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Circle Color:</strong> Stress Level (1–5, blue = low, red = high)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Array.filter() Was Used</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>Array.filter()</code> method removes days with less than 6 hours of sleep, helping focus on
      healthy sleep patterns and clearer data relationships. This made the visualization more meaningful and accurate.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      The scatterplot shows that individuals with higher sleep duration tend to have better productivity.
      Redder circles (high stress) cluster around lower productivity, showing how stress limits performance.
      Filtering the dataset helped highlight consistent sleep trends and removed unnecessary noise.
