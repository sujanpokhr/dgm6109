  <h1>Plot 1 – Screen Time vs Stress</h1>

    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
      As daily screen time increases, my stress levels rise. However, more sleep and balanced productivity may
      reduce this stress. I expect higher screen time to correlate with higher stress and lower sleep duration.
    </p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>
      How does screen time impact stress when factoring in sleep duration and productivity levels?
    </p>

    <h3>Data Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X-axis:</strong> Screen Time (4–10 hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Y-axis:</strong> Stress (1–5 scale)</li>
      <li><strong>Circle Size:</strong> Sleep Hours (5–9 hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Circle Color:</strong> Productivity (1–5 scale, dark = high productivity)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Array.sort() Was Used</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>Array.sort()</code> method sorts the dataset by sleep hours in descending order.
      This ensures that larger circles (more sleep) are drawn first so smaller bubbles remain visible.
      It improved both readability and the accuracy of overlapping data points.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      The visualization reveals a pattern where longer screen time correlates with higher stress.
      Larger circles (indicating more sleep) appear at lower stress values, implying better rest reduces tension.
      The darker-colored circles represent high productivity, often clustering at moderate stress levels.
      Using <code>sort()</code> made the layering of bubbles cleaner and more interpretable.
