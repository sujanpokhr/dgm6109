        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Higher daily screen time is associated with increased stress levels.</strong>

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <div class="section">
     <h2>About This Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      This visualization uses a radial (polar) layout to display daily wellness data collected
      over a 30-day period. Each day is represented by a single “petal” positioned around a circle.
      The design allows multiple aspects of wellness to be shown at the same time, making patterns
      and relationships easier to observe than in a traditional linear chart.
    </p>

    <p>
      The visualization was specifically designed to explore how screen time relates to stress,
      while also considering the roles of sleep and productivity.
    </p>

  <!-- HOW TO READ -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>How to Read the Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      Each visual encoding represents a different variable from the dataset:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Angle (around the circle)</strong> represents daily screen time in hours (4–10 hours).</li>
      <li><strong>Distance from the center</strong> represents sleep duration (fewer hours closer to center).</li>
      <li><strong>Color</strong> represents stress level (blue = low stress, red = high stress).</li>
      <li><strong>Size</strong> represents productivity level (larger = more productive).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Background rings and radial guide lines act as axis equivalents, allowing values to be read
      without interaction.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- DATA -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset contains <strong>30 consecutive days</strong> of manually collected personal data,
      spanning from October 8 to November 6, 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      Objective measures include total screen time, time spent on social media, time spent on school
      activities, and hours of sleep. Subjective measures include self-rated stress and productivity
      on a scale of 1 to 5, recorded each evening.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- PATTERNS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Observed Patterns and Trends</h2>
    <p>
      Several clear patterns emerge from the visualization. Days with higher screen time tend to
      cluster in regions with warmer colors, indicating higher stress levels. These days are often
      closer to the center of the chart, showing reduced sleep duration.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast, days with lower screen time are more frequently associated with cooler colors,
      greater distance from the center, and larger petal sizes, indicating lower stress, more sleep,
      and higher productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      One especially notable pattern is a sharp shift in wellness outcomes once daily screen time
      exceeds approximately eight hours. Above this threshold, stress increases rapidly while sleep
      and productivity decrease.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The visualization supports the hypothesis that higher screen time is associated with increased
      stress. However, it also reveals that sleep plays a critical mediating role in this relationship.
      High screen time often coincides with reduced sleep, which in turn contributes to higher stress
      and lower productivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than a gradual decline, the data suggests a threshold effect: wellness outcomes worsen
      significantly once screen time exceeds a certain point.
