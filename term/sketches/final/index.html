            <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
            <p>
                I have been collecting daily data on four interconnected aspects of my life: screen time, 
                stress levels, sleep duration, and productivity ratings. This data spans 14 days and captures:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Screen Time:</strong> Total daily screen exposure in hours, including phone, 
                    computer, and tablet usage (range: 4.8-9.2 hours)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stress Level:</strong> Self-assessed on a 1-5 scale, where 1 represents minimal 
                    stress and 5 represents very high stress (range: 1-5)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sleep Hours:</strong> Total sleep duration per night in hours, measured from 
                    bedtime to wake time (range: 5.5-8.5 hours)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Productivity:</strong> Self-rated daily productivity on a 1-5 scale, where 1 
                    represents very unproductive and 5 represents highly productive (range: 1-5)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SKETCH 1 -->
        <div class="sketch">
            <h3>Sketch 1: Enhanced Scatterplot with Sleep Bubbles</h3>
            
            <h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
            <div class="hypothesis">
                "As daily screen time increases, stress levels increase. Additionally, decreased sleep 
                hours correlate with both higher stress and lower productivity levels."
            </div>
            
            <h4>Data Elements Used:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X-axis:</strong> Screen Time (hours) - Range: 4-10 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Y-axis:</strong> Stress Level (1-5 scale) - Range: 0-6 (extended to show full context)</li>
                <li><strong>Circle Size:</strong> Sleep Hours - Range: 5.5-8.5 hours (larger circles = more sleep)</li>
                <li><strong>Circle Color:</strong> Productivity Level (1-5 scale) - Gradient from light green (#a8e6cf) 
                    representing low productivity to dark green (#004d40) representing high productivity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Visual Representation:</h4>
            <p>
                This bubble plot positions each day as a circle where the horizontal position shows screen time 
                and the vertical position shows stress level. The size of each bubble represents sleep duration, 
                with larger bubbles indicating more sleep hours. The color encodes productivity, with darker green 
                shades representing higher productivity levels. This design allows viewers to see four dimensions 
                simultaneously and identify patterns such as "high screen time combined with low sleep results in 
                high stress and low productivity." The visualization uses proportional sizing (square root scale) 
                to ensure accurate perception of sleep differences, and semi-transparent circles with black outlines 
                prevent larger bubbles from completely obscuring smaller ones.

            <h4>Question:</h4>
            <div class="hypothesis">
                "What are the multi-dimensional patterns between screen time, stress, sleep, and productivity, 
                and can we identify 'healthy' versus 'unhealthy' day profiles based on how these variables 
                cluster together?"
            </div>
            
            <h4>Data Elements Used:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Axis 1:</strong> Screen Time (hours) - Range: 4-10 hours, displayed on vertical scale</li>
                <li><strong>Axis 2:</strong> Stress Level (1-5 scale) - Range: 1-5, displayed on vertical scale</li>
                <li><strong>Axis 3:</strong> Sleep Hours - Range: 5-9 hours, displayed on vertical scale</li>
                <li><strong>Axis 4:</strong> Productivity Level (1-5 scale) - Range: 1-5, displayed on vertical scale</li>
                <li><strong>Line Color:</strong> Stress level - Gradient from blue (#2196f3) for low stress (1-2), 
                    through orange (#ffa726) for moderate stress (3), to red (#f44336) for high stress (4-5)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Visual Representation:</h4>
            <p>
                Four vertical axes are arranged side-by-side at equal intervals, each representing one variable 
                scaled from its minimum to maximum value. Each day in the dataset is represented by a colored line 
                that connects its values across all four axes. Lines are colored based on stress level, making it 
                immediately visible which days were calm (blue) versus stressful (red). This visualization excels 
                at revealing whether certain combinations of values consistently occur together. For example, blue 
                lines (low stress days) tend to pass through high values on the sleep axis and low values on the 
                screen time axis, while also ending high on the productivity axis. This clustering pattern makes it 
                easy to identify "healthy day profiles" versus "unhealthy day profiles" and understand the 
                relationships between all four dimensions simultaneously.

            <div class="hypothesis">
                "Days with optimal sleep (7.5-8.5 hours) cluster toward lower stress and higher productivity, 
                creating a visual 'bloom' pattern when stress is low. As screen time increases, this pattern 
                'wilts' toward higher stress regions, with petals appearing smaller and closer to the center."
            </div>
            
            <h4>Data Elements Used:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Angular Position:</strong> Screen Time (hours) - Range: 4-10 hours, mapped to 0-360 
                    degrees around the circle (like hours on a clock face)</li>
                <li><strong>Radial Distance from Center:</strong> Sleep Hours - Range: 5-9 hours, where points 
                    closer to the center represent less sleep and points further out represent more sleep</li>
                <li><strong>Petal Color:</strong> Stress Level (1-5 scale) - Gradient from calm blue (#2196f3) 
                    for low stress to intense red (#f44336) for high stress</li>
                <li><strong>Petal Shape/Size:</strong> Productivity Level (1-5 scale) - Larger, fuller petal 
                    shapes represent higher productivity (level 4-5), medium shapes represent moderate productivity 
                    (level 3), and smaller petals represent lower productivity (level 1-2)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Visual Representation:</h4>
            <p>
                This creative visualization arranges data in a circular "flower" pattern where each day appears 
                as a petal extending from the center. The center of the circle represents minimal sleep, and 
                petals extend outward based on sleep hours—the more sleep, the further from center. Each petal's 
                angular position around the circle (0-360 degrees) corresponds to screen time hours, similar to 
                hours on a clock. Petal color encodes stress level using an intuitive blue-to-red scale (blue for 
                calm, red for stressed), while petal size represents productivity level. "Healthy days" appear as 
                large blue petals in the outer ring, representing lots of sleep, low stress, and high productivity—
                these petals "bloom" outward. "Unhealthy days" appear as small red petals near the center, 
                representing poor sleep, high stress, and low productivity—these petals "wilt" inward. This 
                metaphorical approach makes the data emotionally resonant and immediately understandable while 
                remaining quantitatively accurate. Concentric guide rings mark different sleep hour zones, and 
                angular markers indicate screen time ranges, ensuring precise data reading despite the creative format.

                <p>
                    <em>How I used it:</em> I used the interactive decision tree on this site to determine which 
                    visualization types work best with my dataset of four numeric variables. Starting from the 
                    "Explore" tab, I selected my data type (numeric for all variables) and the tool suggested 
                    several appropriate formats including scatterplots and parallel coordinates. This directly 
                    influenced my choice of parallel coordinates for Sketch 2, as the site explained that this 
                    format excels at showing patterns and clusters across multiple continuous variables 
                    simultaneously. The examples showed me how lines connecting values across axes can reveal 
                    "profiles" in the data, which aligned perfectly with my goal of identifying healthy versus 
                    unhealthy day patterns.

                <p>
                    <em>How I used it:</em> This interactive example demonstrated the technical implementation of 
                    parallel coordinates plots, showing me exactly how to arrange multiple vertical axes at equal 
                    intervals and connect data points with lines. The example used monochrome lines, but it inspired 
                    me to add stress-based color encoding to make patterns more immediately visible in my Sketch 2. 
                    I also learned from this example that semi-transparent lines are essential when many lines 
                    overlap, as it allows viewers to see density patterns where multiple days share similar profiles. 
                    The axis labeling approach in this example informed my decision to clearly label each axis at 
                    both top and bottom with variable names and ranges.

                    <em>How I used it:</em> The Dear Data project's organic, hand-drawn visualizations inspired my 
                    Sketch 3 radial flower design. Specifically, I studied several weeks where the creators used 
                    radial and circular layouts to represent time-based personal data. Week 3's "A Week of Complaints" 
                    used radial positioning to encode different aspects of data, which helped me conceptualize how 
                    to map my four variables onto a circular structure. The project taught me that creative, 
                    metaphorical visualizations can be both emotionally engaging and quantitatively accurate when 
                    designed with clear encoding rules. This inspired me to use the "blooming flower" metaphor where 
                    healthy days bloom outward and unhealthy days wilt inward, making the data more intuitive and 
                    memorable while maintaining precise numerical relationships through radial distance and angular position.

                    <em>How I used it:</em> This chapter's detailed explanation of the "rule of proportional ink" 
                    was crucial for my Sketch 1 design. The reading explained that when encoding data with area 
                    (such as circle size), the visual element's area should be proportional to the data value, not 
                    the radius. This taught me to use a square root scale (d3.scaleSqrt) for my bubble sizes rather 
                    than a linear scale, ensuring that a day with 8 hours of sleep appears to have twice the circle 
                    area (not twice the radius) of a day with 4 hours of sleep. Without this reading, my bubble plot 
                    would have contained visual distortions that could mislead viewers about the magnitude of sleep 
                    differences. The chapter also reinforced the importance of using appropriate color scales, which 
                    influenced my choice of a single-hue gradient (light to dark green) for productivity in Sketch 1 
                    rather than a multi-hue rainbow that might imply ordering where none exists.

                    <em>How I used it:</em> Studying award-winning visualizations from The New York Times and other 
                    publications taught me that clarity and immediate comprehension should take priority over visual 
                    complexity or "coolness factor." Many winning designs used simple, clear visual encodings with 
                    comprehensive legends rather than elaborate graphics. This influenced several decisions across all 
                    three sketches: keeping my color schemes simple and intuitive (blue for calm, red for stress), 
                    ensuring all axes have clear labels with units, and including detailed legends that explain every 
                    visual encoding. The examples also showed me the importance of annotations and callouts that guide 
                    the viewer's attention to key patterns, which I incorporated into all three sketches with text 
                    labels like "High screen time → higher stress" and "Healthy days bloom outward."

                    <em>How I used it:</em> I used the "Search by Function" page to explore visualization types 
                    suitable for showing correlations and comparisons across multiple variables. This catalogue 
                    provided clear explanations of when to use each chart type and what kinds of insights each 
                    reveals. It helped me confirm that scatterplots are ideal for showing correlations between two 
                    continuous variables (Sketch 1) and that adding size and color encodings can extend this to four 
                    dimensions. The catalogue's description of radial visualizations also validated my creative 
                    approach in Sketch 3, showing that circular layouts can effectively represent cyclical or 
                    related data when designed with clear positional encodings.
